<!-- const varName = document.getElementById('elementID')

    Syntax -> varName.innerText / varName.textContent / varName.innerHTML

    innerText, textContent and innerHTML -> all of them give us the content inside the targetted element, but 
    what is the difference between them ?

    innerText -> gives only the text that is actually visible.

    textContent -> gives all the text either visible or not(text which is hidden by any CSS property).

    innerHTML -> it also gives us all the text content along with the inner HTML tag in the targetted element.

    we can also modify the content with these

    like -> varName.innerText = "new content"
